        <h1>PROFILE</h1>
        <h2>Recruiter</h2>
        <p>I have over 10 years or technical and business recruitment experience. I have worked in the manufacturing and high-tech industries, and worked with a very diverse pool of candidates: from early career/internship/new graduate talent, all the way to leadership and executive level.</p>
        <p>I specialize in DEI sourcing and recruiting within the legal framwork of the United States. I am also knowledgable in hiring practices and employment culture of various countries in APAC, such as Singapore and Japan.</p>
        <h2>Coach</h2>
        <p>I am a CTI-trained life coach, strongly believing in all of us being naturally resourceful, creative, and whole. While my training has provided me skills useful in general life coaching, I specialize in career coaching and have deep experience working with individuals suffering from imposter syndrome.</p>
        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>I am a Coding Dojo certified full stack developer (Java). Favorite framework: Spring Boot.</p>
